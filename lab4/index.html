					<h2>How to make Bannana Bread</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Gather Ingredients</li>
						<li>Preheat your oven to 350Â°F and grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
						<li>Place bananas in a large bowl and mash them. Add all the other ingredients to the bowl, and whisk just until combined.</li>
						<li>Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean.</li>
						<li>Let the cake cool for 15 minutes on a wire rack, then turn it out from the pan and let it cool completely.</li>
						<p>Enjoy your delicious homemade banana bread!</p>
					</ol>

					<h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>The computer chooses a random option (rock, paper, or scissors).</li>

						<ul>
							<li>Rock beats scissors</li>
							<li>Paper beats rock</li>
							<li>Scissors beats paper</li>
							<li>If both the computer and the user choose the same option, it's a tie.</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The winner is announced to the user.</li>
						<li>Repeat from step 1 if the user wants to play again, or end the game if they don't.</li>
					</ol>
